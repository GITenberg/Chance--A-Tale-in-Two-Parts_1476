description: "Chance is a novel by Joseph Conrad, published in 1913 following serial\
  \ publication the previous year. Although the novel was not one upon which Conrad's\
  \ later critical reputation was to depend, it was his greatest commercial success\
  \ upon initial publication.\nChance is narrated by Conrad's regular narrator, Charles\
  \ Marlow, but is characterised by a complex, nested narrative in which different\
  \ narrators take up the story at different points. The novel is also unusual among\
  \ its author's works for its focus on a female character: the heroine, Flora de\
  \ Barral.\nThe narrators describe and attempt to interpret various episodes in the\
  \ life of Miss de Barral, the daughter of a convicted swindler named Smith de Barral\
  \ (though this character is famous in the world of the novel as a criminal, he may,\
  \ at least at first, have been merely an incompetent banker). Miss de Barral leads\
  \ a sheltered life while her father is prosperous, then must rely on the generosity\
  \ of others, who resent her or have agendas for her, before she escapes by marrying\
  \ one Captain Anthony. Much of the book involves the musing of the various narrators\
  \ over what she and the Captain expected from this union, and what they actually\
  \ got from it. When her father is released from prison, he joins them on ship, and\
  \ the book heads towards its denouement.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
